# Rules

No slurs at ANY TIME.
No inappropriate, NSFW, or disturbing profile pictures are allowed in the server.
Don't play dumb or be rude to server staff (or anyone, for that matter). 
No spamming (except in the spamming channel), mass mentioning, spam pinging, hacking/exploiting, and/or trolling.
Keep the topic of your message in the correct channel. Failure to do so will result in your messages being deleted.
No name calling, offensive messages, NSFW content, and/or bullying.
No chainmail/copypasta messages. 
No insensitive/offensive media or messages. 
Count in the counting channel one at a time. 
Try to keep arguing/debating in DMs instead of our server.
No telling people to harm themself in any way, even if itâ€™s a joke. 
You cannot post the server invite in your Google Classrooms. 
Whenever a new member joins, they MUST verify themself in the verify channel, or they will be kicked 48 hours after their initial join. This is for safety reasons. (If you have the Member role, you are verified.)
