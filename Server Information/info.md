# Server Info

## Things to note on first join
{: .text-red-300 }

- You will need to verify when you first join. Look for the #verify channel to get started.
- You must listen to Server Staff at all times! (Mod, Admin, Owner, ) Not doing this will result in a punishment.
- Don't ask for staff - We don't hire staff much (maybe once a year?), so please dont ask. Please note that the Owner rank is unobtainable due to the server being owned by a deleted account... we cannot do anything to change that.
